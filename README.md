[DIVOTrack: A Novel Dataset and Baseline Method for Cross-View Multi-Object Tracking in DIVerse Open Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07676)


## Abstract
Cross-view multi-object tracking aims to link objects between frames and camera views with substantial overlaps. Although cross-view multi-object tracking has received increased attention in recent years, existing datasets still have several issues, including 1) missing real-world scenarios, 2) lacking diverse scenes, 3) owning a limited number of tracks, 4) comprising only static cameras, and 5) lacking standard benchmarks, which hinder the investigation and comparison of cross-view tracking methods. To solve the aforementioned issues, we introduce **DIVOTrack**: a new cross-view multi-object tracking dataset for **DIV**erse **O**pen scenes with dense tracking pedestrians in realistic and non-experimental environments. Our DIVOTrack has ten distinct scenarios and 953 cross-view tracks, surpassing all cross-view multi-object tracking datasets currently available. Furthermore, we provide a novel baseline cross-view tracking method with a unified joint detection and cross-view tracking framework named CrossMOT, which learns object detection, single-view association, and cross-view matching with an all-in-one embedding model. Finally, we present a summary of current methodologies and a set of standard benchmarks with our DIVOTrack to provide a fair comparison and conduct a comprehensive analysis of current approaches and our proposed CrossMOT.

## <a id="des">Dataset Description</a>
We collect data in 10 different real-world scenarios, named: `'Circle', 'Shop', 'Moving', 'Park', 'Ground', 'Gate1', 'Floor', 'Side', 'Square', and 'Gate2'`. All
the sequences are captured by using 3 moving cameras: `'View1', 'View2', 'View3'` and are manually synchronized. 

In the old version, the corresponding scenarios named: `'circleRegion', 'innerShop', 'movingView', 'park', 'playground', 'shopFrontGate', 'shopSecondFloor', 'shopSideGate', 'shopSideSquare', 'southGate'`. The corresponding camera is named: `'Drone', 'View1', 'View2'`.

### <a id="str">Dataset Structure</a>
The structure of our dataset as follows:
```

```
### <a id="dow">Dataset Downloads</a>
The whole dataset can be downloaded from [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets/syhao777/DIVOTrack). **Note that, each file needs to unzip by the password. You can decompress each `.zip` file in its folder after sending us (shengyuhao@zju.edu.cn, gaoangwang@intl.zju.edu.cn) the License in any format.** After that, you should run `generate_ini.py` to generate `seqinfo.ini` file. 

## <a id="det">Training Detector</a>
The training process of our detector is in `./Training_detector/` and the details can be seen from  [Training_detector/README.md](https://github.com/shengyuhao/DIVOTrack/tree/main/Training_Detector#readme).
## <a id="sin">Single-view Tracking</a>
We conducted experiments on DIVOTrack in five benchmarks:

| Benchmark | HOTA ↑ | IDF1 ↑ | MOTA ↑ | MOTP ↑ | MT ↑ | ML ↓ | AssA ↑ | IDSw ↓ | FM ↓ |
| --------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ---- | ---- | ------ | ------ | ---- |
| [DeepSort](./Single_view_Tracking/Deepsort/)       | 54.3 | 59.9 | 79.6 | 81.2 | 462 | 50 | 45.0 | 1,920 | **2,504** |
| [CenterTrack](./Single_view_Tracking/CenterTrack/) | 55.3 | 62.2 | 73.4 | 80.6 | **534** | 35 | 49.2 | 1,631 | 2,950 |
| [Tracktor](./Single_view_Tracking/Tracktor/)       | 48.4 | 56.2 | 66.6 | 80.8 | 517 | **22** | 40.3 | 1,382 | 3,337 |
| [FairMOT](./Single_view_Tracking/FairMOT/)         | 65.3 | 78.2 | 82.7 | 81.9 | 486 | 48 | **62.7** | 731   | 3,498 |
| [TraDeS](./Single_view_Tracking/TraDeS/)           | 58.9 | 67.3 | 74.2 | **82.3** | 504 | 38 | 54.0 | 1,263 | 2,647 |

Each single-view tracking baseline is evaluated using [TrackEval](https://github.com/shengyuhao/DIVOTrack/tree/main/TrackEval#readme).

## <a id="cro">Cross-view Tracking</a>
We conducted experiments on the DIVOTrack dataset using six benchmarks as well as our proposed method [CrossMOT](./CrossMOT/)
| Benchmark | CVMA ↑ | CVIDF1 ↑ |
| --------- | ------ | -------- |
| [OSNet](./Cross_view_Tracking/OSNet/)       | 34.3 | 46.0 |
| [Strong](./Cross_view_Tracking/StrongReID/) | 40.9 | 45.9 |
| [AGW](./Cross_view_Tracking/AGW/)           | 57.0 | 56.8 |
| [MvMHAT](./Cross_view_Tracking/MvMHAT/)     | 61.0 | 62.6 |
| [CT](./Cross_view_Tracking/CT/)             | 64.9 | 65.0 |
| [MGN](./Cross_view_Tracking/MGN/)           | 33.5 | 39.4 |
| [CrossMOT](./CrossMOT/)                     | **72.4** | **71.1** |

With the exception of CrossMOT, all of the other Re-ID methods require [Multi_view_Tracking](https://github.com/shengyuhao/DIVOTrack/tree/main/Multi_view_Tracking#readme) to predict the tracking results after they are obtained. Finally, the results of CVMA and CVIDF1 are obtained through [MOTChallengeEvalKit_cv_test](https://github.com/shengyuhao/DIVOTrack/tree/main/MOTChallengeEvalKit_cv_test#readme).
